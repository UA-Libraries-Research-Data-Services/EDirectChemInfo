# PubChem EDirect Recipes

**Notes**

> 1. `user@computer:~$` represents an example terminal prompt name. Actual command/argument input is after the `$`.
> 2. Replace `name@xx.edu` with your email address.
> 3. `\` followed by `>` on the next line represents continued terminal input. You will need to delete the `>` symbol in order to run the scripts as a copy/paste into terminal.
> 4. You should validate your own EDirect scripts and results as there may be unintentional mistakes in these recipes. A convenient method is to compare your EDirect results to the NCBI Web interface search results: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
