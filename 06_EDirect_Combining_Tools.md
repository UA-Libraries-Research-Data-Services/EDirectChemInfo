# Combining EDirect Results with Chemical Depiction (MarvinView) and Plotting (gnuplot)

**Notes**

> 1. Replace `name@xx.edu` with your email address.
> 2. `user@computer:~$` represents an example terminal prompt name. Command/argument input is after the `$`.
> 3. `\` followed by `>` on the next line represents continued terminal input.
> 4. You should validate your own EDirect scripts and results as there may be unintentional mistakes in these recipes!

...in progress, coming soon.
