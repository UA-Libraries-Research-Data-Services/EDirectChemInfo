# EDirectChemInfo

This repository contains various EDirect scripts (i.e., code cookbook recipes) for programmatically obtaining data from various NCBI databases. I have mostly focused on PubMed and PubChem databases here. Interestingly, in all of the documentation and examples I found online, I did not see any PubChem EDirect examples, so this repository should hopefully prove useful.

## Useful Resources

1. NCBI Documentaion for [Entrez Direct: E-utilities on the UNIX Command Line](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/)
2. NIH NLM [The Insider's Guide to Accessing NLM Data](https://dataguide.nlm.nih.gov/)

NCBI also has an [EDirect Cookbook](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/EDirectCookbook). I opted to create a separate repository as I wanted to add some of my own tips, experiences, step-wise instructions, and code output, which did not seem relevant in the official NCBI EDirect Cookbook. However, I will submit the final recipes you see here as a pull request to the NCBI repository.
